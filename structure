For user: FIRST PRIORITY
each trip is made up multiple hops
each hop is a particular instance of a transport
each booking consists of one trip and other passenger details
one booking is confirmed, trip details are added to a booking table along with passenger details
Any changes required from making a booking to the trasport tables must be taken care of

For Agency Manager: LAST PRIORITY
Need to be able to add new types of transport options into tables
Need to delete transport options from tables 
BUT only those of that particular Airline/Agency

for each hop
- initial details needed (compulsory) : from, to, departure data, transport type preferance(default = none)
- can filter by : agencies/arilines/providers, class, price, transport type 
- choose a particular instance -- added to overall trip


need to decide tables and attributes:
- one table per type of transport - main table and related tables
